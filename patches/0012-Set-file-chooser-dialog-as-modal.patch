Subject: [PATCH 12/13] Set file chooser dialog as modal
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The GNOME HIG says, about dialogs:

> General guidelines for all types of dialogs:
> [â€¦]
> - Dialogs should always have a parent window, to which they are modal.

https://developer.gnome.org/hig/patterns/feedback/dialogs.html

At least on GNOME, this change causes the dialog to be visibly attached
to the main Gobby window, and prevents interacting with the main window
until the dialog is closed.
